This project would focus on developing a statistical framework for integrating a density model created with stationary PAM data with existing visual-based SDMs to achieve more accurate models with seasonal context. This project may leverage LISTEN GoMex funding to develop models for sperm whales and beaked whales.\n\nAction items\n\nEstablish collaboration: Meet with Lance Garrison to identify his interest and willingness to convene a working group to support his ongoing effort and work towards broader applicability of the outcomes.\nIdentify resources required: Evaluate whether LISTEN GoMex requires more resources to make these methods broadly applicable.\nConfer with PAM SI Working Group: Working Group determines whether there is substantial interest and priority for continued pursuit of this project. If no-go, determine whether the project may be re-evaluated later based on funds available. Deadline: May 2024. Note: As of May 2024, this project was not selected for funding by the PAM SI Working Group. However, given the synergies between integrating stationary PAM data and mobile PAM data, the SI will leverage any PAM data integration workshops held to assess the state of the science for integrating both data types into species distribution modeling framework. This will advance our analytical readiness to pursue this project at a later time.\nEstablish project team: Establish working group, potentially including colleagues from Duke University, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, etc., to meet periodically with the LISTEN GoMex team to ensure broad regional relevance.\nExpand capacity: If funded, advertise post-doc position to support this effort. Alterntively, the PAM SI could convene a workshop or series of workshops that assess the state of the science for incorporating PAM data into species distribution model frameworks in conjunction with Project 1.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project uses drifting acoustic buoy recorders (aka. DASBRs or drifters) to quantify abundance and distribution of offshore deep diving cetacean populations, primarily goose-beaked, Blainville’s, True’s, and Sowerby’s beaked whales. Previous NMFS stock assessment reports either group beaked whale species together as one general “stock”, or have large coefficients of variation (CV) around the abundance estimates due to the biases of observing them visually (Barlow et al. 2005). PAM provides a viable solution to this problem as each beaked whale species emits species-specific echolocation signals while foraging (Johnson et al. 2004, Baumann-Pickering et al. 2013), and their foraging behavior is predictable. This makes them good candidates for density estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the ways in which density estimation of beaked whales can be done is through towed hydrophone array surveys, but those are limited in the frequency by which they occur. Bottom mounted archival instruments are available, but are costly to deploy at the depths at which beaked whales forage (1000m+), and are out for long periods of time, which leads to a delay in abundance estimates. A more cost effective solution that can complement NMFS standard cetacean line transect abundance surveys while providing quicker estimates, is to utilize drifting acoustic recorders. These instruments are deployed at a location and allowed to drift for a period of time before retrieval. These buoys have already been used to estimate beaked whale densities off the West Coast of the US (Barlow et al. 2021), and are also actively used in the Pacific Islands (McCullough et al. 2021). This project extends PAM drifter efforts to the North Atlantic, and will complement the shipboard efforts conducted by the NEFSC by extending survey periods into poor weather months where there is little temporal effort (e.g. fall, spring).\n\n\n\nProject Goals\n\nEstablish a drifting passive acoustic recording network along the east coast of the US\n\nProvide density estimates of goose-beaked, Blainville’s, True’s, and Sowerby’s beaked whales for NMFS stock assessment reports\n\nSecondary project goals\n\nEstimate sperm whale density per demographic class\n\nRecord distribution of Kogia species\n\nCalculate sound metrics to characterize pelagic ocean soundscapes\n\nBrowse data for presence of ESA listed large cetaceans to be hosted on the Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map\n\n\n\nMap of the survey area with 50 km gridcells (which are used when planning Pacific drifting recorder deployments). Turquoise outlined grids show the grid cells that are targeted for the first fieldwork season, with the orange line highlighting the route that would be taken to deploy the instruments.",
