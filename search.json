    "text": "The SPACIOUS project (Spatial Population Assessment of Cetaceans Integrating acoustic Observations from Uncrewed Systems) aims to develop the analytical framework necessary to integrate PAM data from slow-moving passive acoustic recorders, including underwater gliders and drifting acoustic recorders, into quantitative assessments of population distribution and density. The PAM and UxS SIs are heavily investing in the testing and development of PAM-equipped gliders and this effort will ensure that those developments are more quickly leveraged to improve cetacean assessments. This project will focus on developing a statistical framework that integrates PAM data from underwater gliders and drifters with existing visual-based species distribution models (SDM) to achieve more accurate ensemble models with seasonal context.\nThis project would support the PAM SI objective of advancing data integration by leveraging stationary PAM data and visual data to improve the accuracy of stock assessments by capturing seasonal and long-term changes. This project would focus on developing a statistical framework for integrating a density model created with stationary PAM data with existing visual-based SDMs to achieve more accurate models with seasonal context. This project may leverage LISTEN GoMex funding to develop models for sperm whales and beaked whales.",

If no-go, determine whether the project may be re-evaluated later based on funds available. Deadline: May 2024. Note: As of May 2024, this project was not selected for funding by the PAM SI Working Group. However, given the synergies between integrating stationary PAM data and mobile PAM data, the SI will leverage any PAM data integration workshops held to assess the state of the science for integrating both data types into species distribution modeling framework. This will advance our analytical readiness to pursue this project at a later time.\nEstablish project team: Establish working group, potentially including colleagues from Duke University, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, etc., to meet periodically with the LISTEN GoMex team to ensure broad regional relevance.\nExpand capacity: If funded, advertise post-doc position to support this effort. Alterntively, the PAM SI could convene a workshop or series of workshops that assess the state of the science for incorporating PAM data into species distribution model frameworks in conjunction with Project 1.",
